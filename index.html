       <p>In this video, I am going to share complete tour and honest review of Ideal Beach Resort in Mahabalipuram. This resort is just 2-3 Kms away from major tourist attractions in Mahabalipuram, located at the coast of Bay of Bengal offering private beach access to guests.</p>
        <p>W e stayed at their sea view villa room which has a living room, one bedroom, one guest bathroom and a huge attached bathroom with jacuzzi and bathtub. The view from our balcony and bedroom was mesmerizing. This is a 3-star property located on the Chennai ECR. Though the pricing is little bit on the higher side but the amenities and the view they provide is worth it. Their restaurant serves the best of Indian and Sri Lankan cuisine. They offer outdoor pool and a spa and wellness center to help you unwind and relax.</p>
